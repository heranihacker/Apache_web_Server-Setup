# Project: Apache Web Server Deployment, SSL Configuration, and Backup Automation
## Overview of my project:
In this project, I set up a fully functional Apache Web Server to host multiple websites. Additionally, I secured the server with SSL encryption (HTTPS) using Let’s Encrypt and automated website backups using rsync and cron jobs. This project helped me understand server administration, security practices, and automation for maintaining web servers.
# Skills  i Used:
Apache Web Server Configuration
SSL Installation with Let’s Encrypt
Virtual Host Setup for Multiple Websites
Backup Automation using rsync & cron jobs
Linux Command Line
# Steps i Take:
## Step 1: Accessing the Server
The first step was to access the remote server using SSH (Secure Shell). I received the server's IP address and login credentials from the system administrator (or cloud provider). After logging in through my terminal, I had full control over the server to begin my setup.

## Step 2: Installing Apache Web Server
Once connected to the server, I installed Apache, one of the most widely used web server software, by running the appropriate commands. After installation, I verified that Apache was running by accessing the server's IP address from a browser, where I saw the Apache2 default page.

## Step 3: Setting Up SSL with Let’s Encrypt
To secure the server, I used Let’s Encrypt to install SSL certificates. This allows websites to load securely with HTTPS. Using Certbot, I configured the server to automatically renew the certificates and redirected all traffic to HTTPS for enhanced security.

## Step 4: Hosting Multiple Websites
I set up multiple websites on the same server by configuring Apache's virtual hosts. This allowed each website to have its own directory and configuration, while still being hosted on the same server. I created folders for each website, assigned appropriate permissions, and set up configuration files for each domain.

## Step 5: Automating Backups
To ensure data safety, I automated daily backups using rsync and cron jobs. I wrote a backup script that copied the website data to a backup directory and scheduled it to run at 2 AM every day. This ensures that even if anything happens to the server, the website files can be restored easily.

## Step 6: Final Testing and Verification
After completing the setup, I tested each part to ensure everything was working smoothly:
Apache: I accessed the websites from a browser to ensure they were being served properly.
SSL: I confirmed the SSL certificates were applied correctly and that the websites loaded over HTTPS.
Backups: I verified that the backups were being created as scheduled.

## Outcome:
By completing this project, I deployed an Apache Web Server, implemented SSL security, hosted multiple websites, and automated daily backups. This project gave me real-world experience with web server administration, security, and automation, which are critical skills for any system administrator or DevOps role.

## Conclusion: 
This project helped me develop skills in server management, website security, and backup automation.
I was able to apply my learning and gain practical experience, which will be useful in any future projects or job roles.

## Real-World Application:
This project helps businesses in Ethiopia improve website security, protect data, and reduce server costs. By automating backups, using SSL certificates, and hosting multiple sites on a single server, companies can ensure secure websites, safeguard data, and optimize resources.

## Problem Solved:
Many Ethiopian businesses face challenges like insecure websites, data loss risks, and high server costs. This project addresses these by implementing SSL for security, automating backups, and using virtual hosts to efficiently manage multiple sites on one server.
